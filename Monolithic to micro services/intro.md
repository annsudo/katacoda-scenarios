## What will we learn:
How to split a monolith java application to micro services with help of Eureka server and clients.

## Our Plan:
1) Getting to know monolithic application and Katacoda - enviroment

2) Building our first micro service

3) LetÂ´s scale! Second one..

4) Catalog micro service

5) Pros and Cons of architecture

6) Creating Eureka server

7) Micro services as Eureka-clients

8) Take away

## Keep in mind
To help us to focus on the main concept: MICRO SERVICES, project and environment is already fully configured for you. The data of the JAVA -objects will also be hardcoded into the java classes to make the learning experience easier for us. 

## Recommended prerequisites
Good understanding of Java language and basic knowledge of RESTful API

## Learning by doing they said ;) Let's start!
