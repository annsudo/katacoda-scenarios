In this tutorial we learned:


🔧  **Building with micro services**
 means you are developing your entire application in small, independent components. Each micro-service should perform a single business requirement. 


⭐ **Pros with architecture:**

Independence and Flexibility

Resilience and Sustainability

Scalability and Cross-functionality


💩  **Cons with architecture:**

More effort while deploying

Changes can affect multiple services

Independent testing


💾 **Discovery Server**
is an application that holds the information about all client-service applications. Every micro service will register into it and server will know all the client applications running on each port and IP address.
