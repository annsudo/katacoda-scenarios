## What will we learn:
How to split a monolith java application to microservices with help of Eureka server, clients and load balancer.

## What does building with microservices mean:
It means you are developing your entire application in small, independent components which communicate with each other over private APIs. 

## Our Plan:
1) Gettingt to know application and enviroment

2) Building our first microservice

3) LetÂ´s scale! Second one..

4) But Duplications?

5) Creaing Eureka server

6) Microservices as Eureka-clients

7) Load balancer annotation

## Keep in mind
To help us to focus on the main concept- MICROSERVICES, project and invironment is already fully configured for you. The data of the Podcast-objcts will also be hardcoded into the java classes to make the learning experience easier for us. 

## Recommended prerequisites
Good understanding of Java language and basic knowledge of RESTful API

## Learning by doing they said ;) Let's start!


 ------> Each micro-service should perform a single business requirement.
