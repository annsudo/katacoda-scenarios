## What will we learn:
How to split a monolith java application to microservices with help of Eureka server, clients and load balancer.

## Our Plan:
1) Gettingt to know monolithic application and Katacoda-enviroment

2) Building our first microservice

3) LetÂ´s scale! Second one..

4) Catalog microservice

5) Pros and Cons of architecture

6) Creaing Eureka server

7) Microservices as Eureka-clients

8) Take away

## Keep in mind
To help us to focus on the main concept- MICROSERVICES, project and invironment is already fully configured for you. The data of the Podcast-objcts will also be hardcoded into the java classes to make the learning experience easier for us. 

## Recommended prerequisites
Good understanding of Java language and basic knowledge of RESTful API

## Learning by doing they said ;) Let's start!
